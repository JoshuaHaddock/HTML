    <h1> About Me </h1>

        <h1>What made my interested in joining this bootcamp.</h1>
        <li>The reason I took interest in this course if because i wanted to further develop my digital skills. <br> I took a level 3 BTEC IT course in college however, i wasn't really interested in coding at that time and didn't remember any of it when i finished college. <br>So after finishing my apparenticeship i started to look into courses that i could potentially increase my IT knowledge. <br>I then found out about Growth Company and had a look at the courses that they offer and ended up finding this course. I thought this course could help me with furthering my digital knowdlege and decided that i wanted to join it. </li>
